# Drawing multiple stars
## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) 

Create a `drawStar(int x, int y)` method that allows you to draw a star on a certain given location. The location is entered as a x,y coordinate which refers to the top-left corner of the star (see image below). Make sure that the star **does not** fill the entire screen, as we want to place multiple stars in the screen.

Fill out the screen with stars as shown in the example by invoking your newly created method several times.
