# Counting from 1 to 100 easily
## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) 

Write a program that prints all numbers between 1 and 100 using a while-loop. Because the SaxionApp doesn't really scroll (and we want to generate quite a bit of output!), you should use `System.out.println(..)` instead to see what your program does.

## Example
```Java
1
2
3
4
5
... etc
95
96
97
98
99
100
```
