# Shifting colors
## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-outlined.svg) 

Besides the dimensions we can also use variables to adjust the color. Create a program that increases the "redness" of a color in steps of 50 (starting at 100) and keep redrawing a figure to show this color.

Create an image that reflects this color change. Make it funny or creative (like a sunset). Just because we are lazy (and have given you a circle in the example), doesn't mean you have to be!

(Note the "export" statement is our tool saving these example images. You don't have to see this in your version.)
