# Counting from 100 to 1
## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) 

Similarly to the previous exercise, write a program that prints all numbers between 100 and 1 using a while-loop. Because the SaxionApp doesn't really scroll, you should use `System.out.println(..)` instead to see what your program does.

## Example
```Java
100
99
98
97
... etc
4
3
2
1
```
