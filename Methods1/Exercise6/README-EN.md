In this course you will create the Noughts And Crosses game (or _TicTacToe_). At the end of the module you will have a full interactive game ready, but for now we'll start off easy.

The assignment is to create the board as shown in the picture. You can use the SaxionApp methods ```drawLine``` and ```drawBorderedText```.
Most of the work is in getting the coordinates right.

For this game we use a slightly smaller screen of 350*350 pixels.
You also see in the code some comments, that will help you structure the code.

(_Hint_: If you want to get rid of the border around the text, have a look at `setBorderSize(...)`.)
