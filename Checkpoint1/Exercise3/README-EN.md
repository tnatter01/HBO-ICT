# Drawing a full pyramid
## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) 

Create a program that draws a full pyramid. The pyramid should be adjustable in height, but doesn't need to be entered by the user (it can be hardcoded).

Besides drawing the pyramid, you **must** resize the screen to perfectly fit the pyramid. This means that you'll need to calculate the dimensions of the screen and resize the frame accordingly. (Note that you can disregard the bottom "status bar" in your calculations.. if you want to!)
