## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) 

Create your own version of the number guessing game as demonstrated in this [video](https://youtu.be/UUmuocVLgBQ). 

Obviously you are allowed to make your own (minor) adjustments like the texts and values, as long as the functionality (random number generation, rounds, feedback on a guess, being able to guess correctly) is there.
