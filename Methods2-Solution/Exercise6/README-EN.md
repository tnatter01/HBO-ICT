# Generating colors
## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) 

Create a program that allows you to set the background color, based on the values of _red_, _green_ en _blue_ (RGB model) entered by the user.

Besides the RGB values, colors could also be expressed as hexadecimal numbers and just to show you what a method looks like, we have created the `convertRGBToHex` method that can generate such a code for you. Note that it does **not** matter that you don't fully understand the method itself, but have a look at how you could use it (so what needs to go in and what will be the result).

_Hint:_ A Color is also a type of variable in Java that you can use to store a color. There is a SaxionApp method that allows you to enter the rgb values and returns a variable of this type so you can store it.
