If you want to learn a little more about markdown (what we use here), you should really check out [this tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

Try writing some text about yourself in Markdown. Get familiar with the different views (editor vs preview or combined) so you know what to expect in the next weeks.

Finally, write something about yourself using the Markdown layout.
