You don't have to do anything to get this program to work, except run the code! And learn what some of the buttons do.. (How you do terminate an application?)

Check out the image below. Your interface should (almost) be identical to this screen. We have added the numbers 1-9 to this image all refering to some part of the screen you'll use in the coming weeks. Go explore and try to discover what all the parts mean / do. Can you give us an overview?

Write them down below so you can find them again later!
