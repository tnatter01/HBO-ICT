The application in this demo doesn't do anything.
Well, it's not nothing: a window in which to print programmed drawings.
If you have a look at the code you see there is already some in it:

```
import nl.saxion.app.SaxionApp;

public class Application implements Runnable {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SaxionApp.start(new Application());
    }
```
You will see this code in all assignments in this module.

You will be working the next bit of code:
```
    public void run() {

        // Your code goes here!!!! <--

    }
```
Your code will go between the two curly brackets.

You have already seen some code.
Copy some code from other files and print a text or something else you want to print.
You can copy with the usual copy/paste method of your computer.
