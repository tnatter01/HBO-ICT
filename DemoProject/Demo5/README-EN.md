This program is an example of what you are _eventually_ going to learn in this course. Note that this particular example is perhaps a bit too high level (notice the 4 stars), but overall it provides a clear example of how you can realize a powerful program with just a few lines of code.

In general, this program takes a datafile (all street lights in the city of Enschede) and renders them onto the canvas at their respective locations. All the dots are individual street lights. The green dots represent lower hanging street lights (usually in smaller streets or near houses) while the pink dots represent the higher positioned street lights. By printing out each street light individually, you are effectively creating a "map" of the city of Enschede - with hardly any effort!

Try to read the code. It is okay that you have the feeling you wouldn't be able to think of this yourself, but the code is most likely readable and quite understandable if you look at it. The next few weeks, you'll learn how to write readable code like this!
