#Transforming Mario into Luigi 
## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-outlined.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) (or 4 stars, because it's a big one!) 

One of our collegues went over the top with the SaxionApp and drew Mario as you can see in the example.

If you want to draw Mario yourself, please do so. It's a really good exercise to get familiar with programming, but it'll take some time. We have added a gif image to illustrate how the building process works.

Execute the following assignments **and run the program after each assignment to check if it is working correctly**:
1. First, just run the program and see what it does.
2. Change the code so that the program runs without pausing. Do this not by deleting the relevant code lines, but by disabling them with //.
3. Change the color of Mario's jacket and cap.
4. The variable name for the color of the eyes is unclear and does not follow the logic of the other variable names. Change the name of the variable so that it does fits the rest of the color variables. You have to do this in the line where the variable is declared, but also everywhere the variable is used. (_Hint_: IntelliJ can help you out with this as this process is also known as _refactoring_.)
