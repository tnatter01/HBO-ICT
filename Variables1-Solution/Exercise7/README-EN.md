# Pixelart Easy 
## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-outlined.svg) 

You are going to program your own pixelart animation. The image should be fully scalable. Therefore, we have added the variable `size`, which describes the size of a pixel.

Create a small rectangle in the middle of the screen and make it grow in four steps.

Use `pause` to wait for the user to press a key for the next step.

We have already created variables for you that describe the color in the image and the size of the pixels.

When you are finished with the drawing, tryout the effect of changing the size of the pixels.
